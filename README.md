## Description

I was tasked to use Jquery to create a work day scheduler.  This task seemed simple enough but after a bit of work I realized that even though JQuery made a lot of the tasks more concise I still needed to create logic that was very precise.  I struggled to get the text to persist after a refresh and how to target the timeblock individually.  
After working with my tutor I realized that not only did I need to parseInt the IDs on my text areas but i needed to parseInt the hour coming directly from moment.js.  This was surprising to me but after that I was able to get more of the functionaily working.  I also needed to use (this) to target the rows individually and that took a bit of trial and error.  I tweaked the colors to make it more comfortable for my eyes and Iâ€™m rather pleased with the results.
